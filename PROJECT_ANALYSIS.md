# Looma Project Analytics Report

## Overview
This is a React-based quiz platform with Firebase backend for student quizzes and admin management. The project uses Vite, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase for authentication and data storage.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Quiz Submission Issue: Anonymous Registration Numbers
**Problem**: Quiz submissions are saving `regNumber` as "Anonymous" instead of the actual student registration number.

**Root Cause**: In `src/pages/QuizPage.jsx:77`, the code uses:
```javascript
regNumber: currentUser.displayName || 'Anonymous',
```

However, `currentUser.displayName` is never set during the authentication process. Firebase Auth's `displayName` property defaults to `null` unless explicitly set.

**Impact**: 
- All quiz submissions have "Anonymous" as the registration number
- Impossible to track student performance by registration number
- Admin dashboard cannot properly identify students

**Solution**: Fetch the registration number from the user's Firestore document instead of relying on `displayName`.

### 2. Admin Dashboard Data Fetching Issue: Collection Name Mismatch
**Problem**: Admin dashboard cannot fetch quiz results properly from Firebase.

**Root Cause**: Collection name inconsistency:
- `QuizPage.jsx:95` saves submissions to: `'quizzes/{id}/submissions'`
- `AdminDashboard.jsx:138` fetches results from: `'quizzes/{id}/results'`

**Impact**:
- Admin dashboard shows no results even when students have submitted quizzes
- Statistics (total participants) are incorrect
- Export functionality returns empty data

**Solution**: Standardize collection naming - either change QuizPage to save to `'results'` or change AdminDashboard to read from `'submissions'`.

### 3. Authentication Data Inconsistency
**Problem**: User authentication doesn't maintain registration number in Firebase Auth profile.

**Root Cause**: 
- Registration process saves user data to Firestore but doesn't update Firebase Auth profile
- Login process doesn't sync Firestore data with Auth profile
- Quiz submission relies on Auth profile data instead of Firestore data

**Impact**:
- Loss of student identification during quiz submission
- Inconsistent user data across the application

## Detailed File Analysis

### Registration Flow (`src/pages/Register.jsx`)
✅ **Working Correctly**:
- Saves complete user data including `regNumber` to Firestore
- Creates proper user document with all necessary fields

⚠️ **Missing**:
- Doesn't update Firebase Auth `displayName` with registration number

### Login Flow (`src/pages/Login.jsx`)
✅ **Working Correctly**:
- Authenticates users properly
- Redirects based on user role from Firestore

⚠️ **Missing**:
- Doesn't sync Firestore user data with Firebase Auth profile

### Quiz Submission (`src/pages/QuizPage.jsx`)
✅ **Working Correctly**:
- Quiz logic and timing functionality
- Answer collection and scoring
- Submission to Firebase

❌ **Issues**:
- Line 77: `regNumber: currentUser.displayName || 'Anonymous'`
- Line 95: Saves to `'submissions'` collection

### Admin Dashboard (`src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`)
✅ **Working Correctly**:
- Quiz creation and management
- User interface and navigation
- Authentication and role checking

❌ **Issues**:
- Lines 138, 118, 284, 339: Reads from `'results'` collection instead of `'submissions'`
- Statistics calculation fails due to collection mismatch

## Recommended Solutions

### Solution 1: Fix Registration Number in Quiz Submissions
Replace the submission logic in `QuizPage.jsx` to fetch user data from Firestore:

```javascript
// Current problematic code (line 77):
regNumber: currentUser.displayName || 'Anonymous',

// Should be:
const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, 'users', currentUser.uid));
const userData = userDoc.data();
regNumber: userData?.regNumber || 'Anonymous',
```

### Solution 2: Fix Collection Name Consistency
**Option A**: Change QuizPage to use 'results' collection:
```javascript
// Change line 95 in QuizPage.jsx from:
await addDoc(collection(db, 'quizzes', id, 'submissions'), {
// To:
await addDoc(collection(db, 'quizzes', id, 'results'), {
```

**Option B**: Change AdminDashboard to use 'submissions' collection:
```javascript
// Change all instances in AdminDashboard.jsx from:
collection(db, 'quizzes', quizId, 'results')
// To:
collection(db, 'quizzes', quizId, 'submissions')
```

### Solution 3: Enhance Authentication (Optional)
Update user profile during login to sync Firestore data:
```javascript
// In Login.jsx after successful authentication:
await updateProfile(userCredential.user, {
  displayName: userData.regNumber
});
```

## Implementation Priority

1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fix collection name mismatch (Solution 2)
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Fix registration number fetching (Solution 1) 
3. **MEDIUM**: Enhance authentication sync (Solution 3)

## Implemented Fixes

### ✅ Fix 1: Registration Number Issue Resolved
**Changes made to `src/pages/QuizPage.jsx`**:
- Added Firestore user data fetching before quiz submission
- Changed `regNumber: currentUser.displayName || 'Anonymous'` to fetch from user document
- Added additional user data (fullName, department) to submissions for better tracking

### ✅ Fix 2: Collection Name Mismatch Resolved  
**Changes made to `src/pages/AdminDashboard.jsx`**:
- Updated `fetchResults()` function to read from 'submissions' collection
- Updated `fetchStats()` function to count participants from 'submissions'  
- Updated `handleDeleteQuiz()` function to delete from 'submissions'
- Updated `clearResults()` function to clear from 'submissions'
- Fixed timestamp field reference from 'timestamp' to 'submittedAt'

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing fixes:
1. Test quiz submission with real student account
2. Verify admin dashboard displays correct submission data
3. Check statistics accuracy
4. Test CSV export functionality
5. Verify registration numbers appear correctly in admin view

## Firebase Structure Overview

**Current Structure**:
```
users/
  {uid}/
    - fullName
    - regNumber
    - department
    - email
    - role
    
quizzes/
  {quizId}/
    - title, description, etc.
    submissions/ (from QuizPage)
      {submissionId}/
        - userId, regNumber, score, etc.
    results/ (expected by AdminDashboard)
      (empty - causing the fetch issue)
```

**Security Considerations**:
- Firebase config is exposed in source code (not recommended for production)
- Consider using environment variables for Firebase configuration
- Implement proper Firestore security rules
